  "summary": "REQ-9 and REQ-10 appear implemented via new BengaliShayari and RevealTeddy components wired into the reveal screen. REQ-11’s “page open” burst behavior is implemented in RosePetals, but the burst interval timer is not clearly cleaned up on unmount, which may violate the no-runaway-intervals acceptance criterion.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-11",
      "requirement": "No performance issues or runaway intervals/animation frames occur after repeated page refreshes (proper cleanup of timers/animation).",
      "reason": "The new burstInterval created with setInterval is a local const and is cleared only after the 2-second timeout; the cleanup function does not clear burstInterval if the component unmounts before the timeout fires, which can leave an active interval running.",
